        <h2>Introduction to Evaluation Metrics</h2>
        <p>Evaluation metrics are crucial in machine learning to measure the performance of models. They help assess how well the model predicts outcomes, identifies errors, and ensures its suitability for the intended application. Choosing the right metric depends on the problem type, such as classification, regression, or ranking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Classification Metrics</h2>
        <p>Classification models predict discrete labels. Some commonly used evaluation metrics are:</p>
        <h3>1. Accuracy</h3>
        <p>Accuracy measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances:</p>
        <pre><code>Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Best for balanced datasets.</p>

        <h3>2. Precision</h3>
        <p>Precision evaluates how many of the predicted positives are actually positive:</p>
        <pre><code>Precision = TP / (TP + FP)</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Useful in scenarios like spam detection, where false positives must be minimized.</p>

        <h3>3. Recall (Sensitivity)</h3>
        <p>Recall measures how many actual positives the model correctly identifies:</p>
        <pre><code>Recall = TP / (TP + FN)</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Critical for applications like medical diagnosis, where missing positives can be costly.</p>

        <h3>4. F1 Score</h3>
        <p>The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:</p>
        <pre><code>F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Ideal for imbalanced datasets where both Precision and Recall are important.</p>

        <h3>5. ROC-AUC</h3>
        <p>The Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) evaluates the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate.</p>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Effective for assessing binary classification models.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Regression Metrics</h2>
        <p>Regression models predict continuous values. Key metrics include:</p>
        <h3>1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h3>
        <p>MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values:</p>
        <pre><code>MAE = (Σ |y - ŷ|) / n</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Easy to interpret and less sensitive to outliers.</p>

        <h3>2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)</h3>
        <p>MSE calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values:</p>
        <pre><code>MSE = (Σ (y - ŷ)^2) / n</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Penalizes larger errors more, useful for applications where large deviations matter.</p>

        <h3>3. R-squared (R²)</h3>
        <p>R² explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables:</p>
        <pre><code>R² = 1 - (Σ (y - ŷ)^2 / Σ (y - ȳ)^2)</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Helps understand how well the model explains data variance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Multi-class Classification Metrics</h2>
        <p>For multi-class problems, metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are extended using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Micro-averaging:</strong> Aggregates contributions of all classes before calculating metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Macro-averaging:</strong> Calculates metrics for each class individually and averages them.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted Averaging:</strong> Weighs each class by its support (number of true instances).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges in Metric Selection</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right evaluation metric can be challenging. Factors to consider include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Imbalanced Datasets:</strong> Metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are better than Accuracy for imbalanced datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Domain-specific Requirements:</strong> For example, in fraud detection, minimizing false negatives is crucial.</li>
            <li><strong>Overfitting Risks:</strong> Cross-validation helps ensure metrics generalize well to unseen data.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Evaluation metrics are the cornerstone of machine learning model assessment. Selecting the right metric ensures your model aligns with the business objectives and provides actionable insights. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different metrics, you can make informed decisions and build robust machine learning models.</p>
