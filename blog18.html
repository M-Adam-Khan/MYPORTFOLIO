        <h2>What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?</h2>
        <p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to handle sequence data by retaining information over time. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs incorporate loops, allowing them to persist information and make decisions based on both current input and historical context.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Do RNNs Work?</h2>
        <p>RNNs utilize feedback connections, enabling information to cycle through the network. At each time step, the network takes an input, combines it with its internal memory (hidden state), and generates an output. Key components include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden States:</strong> Preserve temporal information across time steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Weights:</strong> Shared across all time steps to ensure consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Introduce non-linearity, typically through functions like Tanh or ReLU.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Applications of RNNs</h2>
        <p>RNNs are widely used in tasks that involve sequential data. Here are some common applications:</p>

        <h3>1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Language Modeling:</strong> Predicting the next word in a sentence.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Generation:</strong> Generating coherent and contextually relevant text.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Identifying emotions in text data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Time-Series Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stock Price Prediction:</strong> Analyzing trends in financial markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Forecasting:</strong> Predicting temperature, rainfall, or other metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Speech Recognition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transcription:</strong> Converting audio speech into text.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Commands:</strong> Recognizing and responding to spoken instructions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Variants of RNNs</h2>
        <p>While standard RNNs are powerful, they often face challenges like vanishing gradients. Advanced variants address these limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):</strong> Overcomes long-term dependency issues using memory cells and gates.</li>
            <li><strong>Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):</strong> A simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Bidirectional RNNs:</strong> Process input sequences in both forward and backward directions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges of RNNs</h2>
        <p>Despite their capabilities, RNNs come with challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vanishing Gradients:</strong> Difficulty in learning long-term dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> Higher training times compared to feedforward networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Parallelization:</strong> Sequential processing makes RNNs less efficient on modern hardware.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Popular Tools and Frameworks for RNNs</h2>
        <p>Building and training RNNs is made easier with tools like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TensorFlow:</strong> Comprehensive library for deep learning models, including RNNs.</li>
            <li><strong>PyTorch:</strong> Provides dynamic computation graphs and easy debugging.</li>
            <li><strong>Keras:</strong> High-level API for rapid prototyping.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Future of RNNs</h2>
        <p>Although newer architectures like Transformers dominate AI, RNNs still hold relevance for tasks requiring sequential data understanding. Innovations in hybrid models and attention mechanisms are expanding their capabilities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Recurrent Neural Networks are a cornerstone in deep learning, offering unparalleled capabilities in sequence-based tasks. With continued advancements, RNNs remain a critical tool in AIâ€™s journey toward solving complex problems.</p>
