        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence models capable of creating content such as images, text, music, videos, and even code. It utilizes advanced algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers, to generate new data that mimics existing datasets. This technology is revolutionizing creativity and automating tasks across various industries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Does Generative AI Work?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI models are trained on massive datasets to identify patterns and relationships within the data. Two prominent architectures power these models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> A system with two neural networksâ€”the generator creates new content, and the discriminator evaluates its authenticity, refining the results iteratively.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Models like GPT and DALL-E leverage attention mechanisms to understand context and produce coherent text, images, or other content.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
