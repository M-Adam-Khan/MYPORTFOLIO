        <h2>What Are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are a class of deep learning models specifically designed to process structured grid data such as images. They have revolutionized fields like computer vision, enabling machines to understand visual content with unprecedented accuracy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Do CNNs Work?</h2>
        <p>CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically detect patterns and features in data. These layers apply filters to input images, capturing spatial hierarchies of features like edges, textures, and shapes. The output is then passed through activation functions and pooling layers to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential features.</p>
        <p>The key components of CNNs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Layers:</strong> Extract spatial features by applying kernels.</li>
            <li><strong>Pooling Layers:</strong> Reduce spatial dimensions to optimize computations.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Connected Layers:</strong> Perform high-level reasoning on extracted features.</li>
            <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Add non-linearity for better learning.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
