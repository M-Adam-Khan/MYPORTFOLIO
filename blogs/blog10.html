        <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics the workings of the human brain to process data and create patterns for decision-making. It utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze vast amounts of data and learn complex representations.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>How Does Deep Learning Work?</h2>
        <p>At its core, deep learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers. These layers process input data through neurons, where each neuron applies a mathematical transformation, learns features, and passes the output to the next layer. The model improves itself by adjusting weights using algorithms like backpropagation and gradient descent.</p>
        <p>Key components include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neurons:</strong> The basic units of computation in a neural network.</li>
            <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh that introduce non-linearity.</li>
            <li><strong>Backpropagation:</strong> An algorithm for updating weights based on error gradients.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize loss functions.</li>
        </ul>
