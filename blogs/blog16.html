        <h2>What are Artificial Neural Networks?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that mimic the way biological neurons process information. ANNs are foundational to modern AI, enabling machines to learn patterns, make decisions, and perform tasks that require intelligence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Do Artificial Neural Networks Work?</h2>
        <p>ANNs process data through multiple layers of neurons. Each neuron receives input, applies a weight, passes the result through an activation function, and forwards the output to the next layer. This process helps the network learn by adjusting weights based on errors, a process called backpropagation.</p>
        <p>Key components of ANNs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives the raw data for processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Perform computations to extract patterns and features.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Produces the final prediction or result.</li>
            <li><strong>Weights and Biases:</strong> Parameters that the model adjusts during learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Introduce non-linearity to enable learning of complex patterns.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
