        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning algorithms to generate new, original content such as images, text, music, and videos. At its core, it leverages neural networks to understand patterns in data and create entirely new outputs that mimic those patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Does Image Generation in Generative AI Work?</h2>
        <p>Image generation in Generative AI is primarily powered by advanced neural network architectures. These models are trained on massive datasets of images, learning to identify patterns, textures, and details. The most commonly used techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> GANs use two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together in a feedback loop to create realistic images.</li>
            <li><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):</strong> VAEs encode images into latent representations and then decode them back, generating new images with similar characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Diffusion Models:</strong> These models reverse a diffusion process to generate high-quality, detailed images from random noise.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
