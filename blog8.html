        <h2>What is Transfer Learning?</h2>
        <p>Transfer learning is a revolutionary technique in machine learning and deep learning that leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning utilizes pre-trained models as a foundation, saving time, computational resources, and enhancing performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why is Transfer Learning Important?</h2>
        <p>Training a deep learning model from scratch requires vast amounts of labeled data and significant computational power. Transfer learning addresses these challenges by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saving Time:</strong> Pre-trained models shorten the training process significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Data Requirements:</strong> Effective even with smaller datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving Accuracy:</strong> Builds on the rich features learned by pre-trained models.</li>
            <li><strong>Lowering Costs:</strong> Reduces the need for expensive computational infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Does Transfer Learning Work?</h2>
        <p>The process of transfer learning typically involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Using a Pre-trained Model:</strong> Select a model trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet for image classification tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Use the pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor by freezing its layers and training only the final layers.</li>
            <li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> Adjust the pre-trained model’s weights by training some or all of its layers on the new dataset.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Applications of Transfer Learning</h2>
        <p>Transfer learning has widespread applications across various domains:</p>
