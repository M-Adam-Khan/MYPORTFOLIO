            <h2>What is Supervised Learning?</h2>
            <p>Supervised learning refers to the type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data. Essentially, it involves teaching the model by providing both the input data and the corresponding correct outputs. The goal of supervised learning is to find a mapping function that can predict the output for unseen data based on the patterns it learned during training.</p>
            <p>This technique is one of the most well-known and widely used in machine learning. It forms the foundation for many AI applications, and its versatility allows it to be applied across a range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.</p>
            <p>Supervised learning models learn from a set of input-output pairs, where the model can gradually improve its predictions by adjusting internal parameters based on the feedback provided by the labeled data.</p>

            <h2>Types of Supervised Learning</h2>
            <h3>1. Regression</h3>
            <p>Regression tasks involve predicting a continuous value. The goal is to find a function that maps input data to a numerical output. Common examples of regression tasks include predicting house prices, stock prices, or temperature. In regression problems, the output variable is a real number or continuous value, unlike classification problems where the output is categorical.</p>
            <p>Some of the most widely used regression algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Regression</li>
                <li>Polynomial Regression</li>
                <li>Ridge and Lasso Regression</li>
                <li>Support Vector Regression</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Classification</h3>
            <p>Classification involves predicting a categorical label for an input. In this case, the output variable consists of categories or classes. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam, diagnosing diseases based on symptoms, or recognizing objects in an image are typical classification problems. The model learns to classify input data into predefined classes.</p>
            <p>Common classification algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
                <li>Naive Bayes</li>
                <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Does Supervised Learning Work?</h2>
            <p>The process of supervised learning can be broken down into several key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The first step is gathering labeled data. This data is often collected from various sources, such as databases, sensors, or manual input from users.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Data preprocessing is essential for ensuring the model performs effectively. This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing data to ensure consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Splitting the Data</strong>: Once data preprocessing is complete, the data is typically split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set evaluates how well the model performs on unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: The model is trained using the selected machine learning algorithm. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors in predicting the target values based on the training data.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: After training the model, its performance is evaluated using the test set. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error are used to assess its predictive performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning</strong>: To further optimize the model, hyperparameter tuning is performed. This involves finding the optimal values for parameters such as the learning rate, tree depth, or regularization strength.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labeled Data Availability</strong>: Acquiring a large set of labeled data can be time-consuming and expensive.</li>
                <li><strong>Overfitting</strong>: If a model is too complex, it may overfit the training data, making it less effective on new, unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Bias in Data</strong>: If the training data is biased, the model will learn those biases, leading to inaccurate or unfair predictions.</li>
            </ul>
