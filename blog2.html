            <h2>What is Supervised Learning?</h2>
            <p>Supervised learning refers to the type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data. It involves teaching the model by providing both the input data and the corresponding correct outputs. The goal is to find a mapping function that predicts the output for unseen data based on the patterns it learned during training.</p>
            <p>This technique is widely used in various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. It enables AI to make predictions, classify data, and uncover patterns from large datasets.</p>

            <h2>Types of Supervised Learning</h2>
            <h3>1. Regression</h3>
            <p>Regression is used for predicting continuous values. For instance, predicting house prices, stock prices, or temperature. The output is a real number, unlike classification tasks where the output is categorical.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Regression</li>
                <li>Polynomial Regression</li>
                <li>Ridge and Lasso Regression</li>
                <li>Support Vector Regression</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Classification</h3>
            <p>Classification is about predicting a category for an input. For example, classifying emails as spam or non-spam, or recognizing faces in an image. The output consists of predefined classes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
                <li>Naive Bayes</li>
                <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Does Supervised Learning Work?</h2>
            <p>The process involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathering labeled data from various sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize it.</li>
                <li><strong>Splitting the Data</strong>: The dataset is divided into training and test sets.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Train the model using the training data and fine-tune its parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning</strong>: Optimize model parameters to achieve the best results.</li>
            </ol>
